# Simple Web Application with Next JS

The objective of this build was to create a simple web application based on a provided design. 

It is a React-based single page application (SPA) that contains static content, dynamic content which must be fetched from an external REST endpoint, and a form which collects, validates and posts user data to a REST endpoint. The application will also be able to receive feedback via an API, and behave accordingly.

In effect, it is a useful task to sharpen one's grasp of React, as well as fundamental front-end skills in CSS and JavaScript, by creating the app with limited access to "off-the-shelf" solutions.

This application was built with Next JS, CSS external stylesheets, and Swiper - a JavaScript library that creates modern touch sliders and carousels - and deployed on Vercel.
